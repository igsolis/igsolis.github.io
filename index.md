### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites as it was around the first times we
    began to use Makefiles. Makefiles are something I believe are a crucial part
    of coding and makes things much easier for us to do. Not only that, but we used
    this to make a date converter from the Gregorian Calendar to the Julian Calendar.
    
 * Lab 5
    
    Lab 5, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs as it introduced the use of arguments.
    In this lab we created a sandwich making tool. We had to create a program when ran that asks
    for the three things we wanted on our sandwich, protein, bread, and a condiment. The chosen
    three things would be considered our arguments, which would form our sandwich.
    
 * Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 is a favorite of mine as well because it taught us how to use loops in our program.
    Our goal for this lab was to create a guessing game where ou would have to correctly choose the
    number that was chosen from 1-100. We learned how to use do-while loops in this assiggnment in
    order to achieve our goal.
